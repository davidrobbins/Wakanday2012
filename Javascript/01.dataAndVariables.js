﻿/* Javascript Fundementals *//* JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. *//* An object is a collection of properties, and a property is association between a name and a value. *//* A value of a property can be a function, which is then known as the object's method. *//* In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser (or server), you can define your own objects. *//* 1.
